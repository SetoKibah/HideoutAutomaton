# Purpose: Automate production in the hideout to produce mass profit to fund raids
# Utilize: API with https://tarkov.dev/ and create our own database.

### NEW CHANGES TO TARKOV
# Hideout Stations are currently able to search items, useful tool for automation
# Flea market is undergoing changes, will need monitoring.
# Need to standardize acquiring crafting materials and starting crafts
# Prepare for supervised testing, leading to unsupervised testing with logs


########################################## New Component Idea
# Handler for looted raid items to flea market
# Can pull image data from API (see GraphQL playground)
# Finish raids, leave items in top rows -> Bot runs until no items found
# On end logout

# Bot process
#   - Identify item
#   - Select filter
#   - Gets average price
#   - Places at average price
#   - IF item cannot sell to Flea, Sell to highest Vendor
#   - If no items are detected, assume done and exit game
